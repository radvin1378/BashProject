This is a Terminal based application for entering and finding employee details.

I got hold of this document(Project_Specifications.docx) and made the application just for practising bash scripting.

NOTE: Read the Project_Specification.docx file carefully before installing.

Steps to install:

Execute the "install.sh" as a superuser
 
It'll create the necessary files direcories and files

After it's execution, restart the system

Then at the termninal enter the command `deptmaint` to run the application.
